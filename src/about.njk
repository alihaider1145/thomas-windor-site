            <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Artists paint ideas, not things. This simple truth guides every brushstroke in my studio. I believe anyone can paint—what matters isn't technical skill, but the ideas you bring to the canvas.</p>
            
            <p>Painting is my way of understanding life and discovering happiness. It's not about creating perfect landscapes; it's about exploring what those landscapes mean, what they reveal about the world and about myself.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Painting Therapy?</h2>
            <p>It is called Painting Therapy because it is my Painting Therapy. This is a place for me to express my feelings, my thoughts. Life is always changing. That's why, we always need to be aware of what's happening internally. Being there, is being awake</p>
            
            <p>AI can't enjoy making art. That's why I paint—even if nothing ever sells. The act of painting, the process itself, is where the value lives. Each of my paintings represents a moment of presence, a conversation with myself, a meditation on what it means to be alive.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">An Invitation</h2>
        <p>This isn't just my journey—it's an invitation for you to follow along, paint alongside me, or embark on your own creative exploration. Every week, I share a new episode where I paint and reflect. Whether you pick up a brush yourself or simply watch, you're part of this process.</p>
        <p>Join me in celebrating nature, exploring ideas, and discovering what painting can teach us about ourselves.</p>
